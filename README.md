  git clone https://github.com/OFTGNOV/Library_Management_System.git
```

### **2️⃣ Open the Project in Your IDE**
You can use **Visual Studio Code**, **Visual Studio**, or any IDE of your choice.

## 🔄 **How to Contribute (Daily Workflow)**

### **1️⃣ Pull the Latest Changes Before Coding**
To ensure you have the latest code before making changes:
```sh
git pull origin main
```

### **2️⃣ Make Your Code Changes**
Edit the necessary files in the project.

### **3️⃣ Stage and Commit Your Changes**
After making changes, save them to Git:
```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Added feature XYZ"
```
Replace `"Added feature XYZ"` with a meaningful message describing your changes.

### **4️⃣ Push Your Changes to GitHub**
Once you're done, upload your changes:
```sh
git push origin main
```

### **5️⃣ (Optional) Working on a New Feature? Use a Branch!**
If you're adding a major feature, create a separate branch:
```sh
git checkout -b feature-branch
```
After finishing your feature, push it:
```sh
git push origin feature-branch
```
We will review and merge it into `main` later.
